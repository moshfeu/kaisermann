### Hey 👋🥝

<samp>

My name is Christian (Kaisermann), a web engineer with almost a decade of industry experience. I'm passionate about nature 🌳, cats 🐈, ducks 🦆 and writing code to help others 💻. Front-end infrastructure (tooling, libraries, frameworks) and CSS architecture are my things 🌊.

Oh, did you know duck armies were a thing?
